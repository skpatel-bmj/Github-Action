## What is GitHub Action
GitHub Actions is an automation platform provided by GitHub that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repositories. 
It enables you to define custom workflows and automate various tasks, such as running tests, generating documentation, deploying applications, or performing code analysis.
With GitHub Actions, you can create workflows using YAML syntax, which specify a series of steps to be executed when triggered by specific events, 
such as pushing code, creating pull requests, or scheduling periodic jobs.
